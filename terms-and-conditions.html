              the prerequisite for opening an account is a smartphone, with an
              active phone number, that meets our minimum technology

            </p>

              least 18 years old, a Nigerian citizen, meet our technology
              requirements defined above and have not yet opened an account with

              an active phone number, your profile picture and BVN supplied.
              With more information supplied, such as valid identification
              documents, we will be able to open an account without any
              restrictions. Our accounts are tiered as follows:

            <br />
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Account Type</th>
                <th>Required Documentation</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Basic</td>
                <td>Name, Phone Number, BVN</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Full KYC</td>

                  Name, Phone Number, BVN, Valid ID (National ID Card, Voters
                  Card, Drivers Licence, and National Passport)

            </table>
            <br />
            <p>
              In line with regulations, we perform due diligence on all accounts
              so it is your responsibility to keep your mailing address, email
              address, physical address and other contact information up-to-date
              in your profile.
            </p>

              communicate in English.

            <h4>Notifications</h4>
            <p>
              By opening an account with us, you consent to receiving text
              (SMS), email and push notifications from us. These notifications
              are meant for your consumption only and we will not be held liable
              if you suffer any loss, or damage as a result of unauthorised
              access to the information sent.

            <p>
              In addition, by opening this account, you agree to opt out of
              mandatory SMS alerts directed by the CBN in favor of push
              notifications. You agree to indemnify Fiatswap against all losses,
              damages, claims, demands and expenses whatsoever which may be
              incurred, imposed or suffered by the Bank as well as against all
              actions, proceedings or claims (including attorney's fees) whether
              civil or criminal, which may be brought against Fiatswap by reason

            <br />

            <h4>Spending Account</h4>
            <p>
              With the Fiatswap spending account, you will be able to fund your
              Fiatswap account via bank transfers, cash at selected partner
              banks, and a stored card. You will be able to pay bills, make
              instant transfers, manage your Fiatswap card and save as you

            </p>

            <br />

            <h4>Spend & Save</h4>
            <p>
              Upon enrolment in Spend & Save, we will transfer a user-determined
              percentage of any user-induced debit on your account to an
              interest earning sub-account. This feature can be enabled and
              disabled from the Spend & Save section of the app.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Fiatswap Card</h4>
            <p>
              We issue the Fiatswap Visa Card, pursuant to a license from Visa
              International. When we issue you a card, it must be used for only
              lawful transactions within Nigeria. The card will have an expiry
              date and is valid until the last day of the month shown on the
              card. Your card will be auto-renewed upon expiration, unless your
              account is closed or the card is revoked.
            </p>
            <p>
              The PIN issued with your card enables you to carry out
              transactions such as withdrawals and purchases from ATMs, Point of
              Sale terminals and Web/Online platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you use your card for transactions on other channels which
              are not owned and controlled by the Bank, the rules of use of that
              channel apply in addition to these rules.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Fiatswap Save</h4>
            <p>
              Fiatswap Save helps you save money with minimal effort. To do
              this, we can either debit your Fiatswap Bank account at
              user-determined frequency or you can make a one-time lump sum
              savings. Upon expiration of the tenor, the accumulated funds will
              be transferred to your Fiatswap Bank account. You can make
              withdrawals prior to the expiration of the tenor. This can be done
              at no charge for recurring savings, but for one-time lump sum
              savings, there will be a charge. This charge is either the
              interest earned if fixed or 5% of the amount withdrawn if
              flexible.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Closing an account</h4>
            <p>
              You can close your account at any time and at no cost. If you’d
              like to do this, please get in touch with us. You will, however,
              remain liable for any obligations related to your account with us.
              Once the account is closed, you will not be able to access any
              Fiatswap services.
            </p>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to close, suspend, freeze or limit access to
              your account, if:
            </p>
